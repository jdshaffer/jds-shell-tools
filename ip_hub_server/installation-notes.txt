Installing and Running the IP-Hub
----------------------------------
2025-06-21



PREPARE THE ENVIRONMENT
- Make a directory for the IP-hub to use
     mkdir ip_hub_server

- Create a Python environment for it (i.e., iphub)
  (I created my venv folder inside the ip_hub_server folder)
     python3 -m venv iphub

- Activate the environment
     source iphub/bin/activate

- Install necessary python modules
     pip install Flask

- Copy the ip_hub_server.py file into the directory




CONFIGURE TO RUN AS A SYSTEMD SERVICE
- Edit the ip-hub.service.txt file
     - Make sure the "User", "WorkingDirectory",
       and "ExecStart" directories are correct

- Create the ip-hub.services file in /etc/systemd/system
     sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ip-hub.service

- Copy-paste the contents from ip-hub.services.txt to
  the new ip-hub.service file in /etc/systemd/system




START THE SERVER AND TEST IT
- Reload systemd, enable, and start the service
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload          # Reload systemd to recognize new service
     sudo systemctl enable ip-hub.service  # Enable service to start on boot
     sudo systemctl start ip-hub.service   # Start the service immediately

- Check service status (should return "Active: active (running))"
     sudo systemctl status ip-hub.service
